# Embedded implementations

These embedded implementations have been generated from the Matlab implementation, cleaned up, and a `compile.sh` script has been added for ease of use. 

They require the ARM C compiler for the CPU version, and the `nvcc` toolchain from Nvidia for the GPU versions.

They have only been tested on the Jetson Orin Nano.
